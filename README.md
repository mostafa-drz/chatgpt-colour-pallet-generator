# ChatGPT Colour Pallet Generator

A simple Next.js App to experiment with OpenAI API. This app uses [Create Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).

To run the App, first you need [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). You need to add that as an environment variable to `.env.local`. 

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Now you can install the dependencies and start the app:
```
yarn install && yarn dev
```
